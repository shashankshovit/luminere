You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the worked,
but when you're finished,
you'll know absolutely nothing whatever
about the bird...So let's look at the bird
and see
what it's doing -- that's what counts. I learned very early the difference
between knowing the name of something and knowing something... "RICHARD FEYMAN"
