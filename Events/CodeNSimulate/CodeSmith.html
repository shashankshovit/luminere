<h2>Introduction </h2>
Are you a programming God? Do you find the challenge of solving algorithmically challenging problems enticing? Then this is the event for you! Solve nerve racking problems, debug seemingly correct code and code your way to be declared the Gods of the trade... 
<dl><h2>Rules :</h2>
 	
   <dd>    • Teams of two shall participate.
   <dd>    • The contest is divided into two rounds: a screening round, and the
         final round.
    <dd>   • Round I will be a written round comprising of 30-35 
         questions involving output predictions, debugging and code 
         corrections.
         Duration: 50 minutes.
    <dd>   • Round II is the final round and this is where you'll actually be 
         coding. 
         6 questions, 1.5 hours. 
   <dd>    • The code will be machine tested and only perfectly correct results
         will be awarded marks. Partial code will NOT be rewarded.
    <dd>   • Code will be judged on the basis of the time taken and the
         memory used.
    <dd>   • The programming languages to be used in round II will
