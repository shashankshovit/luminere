<h2>Introduction </h2>
Present yourself in front of judges and students about your research work and technical topic within time limit. Here , We  provide you a National level plateform for showing your skills.
Receiving and selecting of abstract and  gathering for presentation are steps for this event.
<h2>Details and Rules:</h2>
<br>1. A maximum of 3 participants are allowed per team all of them belonging to the same institute. No entrant can be a part of more than one team. There is no limitation on the number of teams from an institute at any stage of the competition.

<br>2. Papers to be presented at LUMINERE’11 will be selected only on the basis of the originality. 

<br>3. The screening will be done on the basis of the abstract.The abstract should be mailed to                                     analysisppt@yahoo.com on or before 12th Novembor, 2011.

<br>4. Partcipants have to specify the category in which they want to present paper. If one is presenting paper from ampere category,he has to write subject name as "ampere_(team name)".

<br>5. Participants should send their name , college id, college name,phone number along with their abstract. 

<br>6. Acknowledgement of the receipt of the entries would be sent through email.

<br>7. Participants whose abstract will be short listed shall be informed personally through emails and phone on or before 13 November 2011.

<br>8. Selected participants will have to give their presentations in Microsoft PowerPoint.

<br>9. Each team will get a maximum of 10 minutes for presentation and 2 minutes for queries. If exceeded, the marks may be deducted accordingly.

<br>10. A presentation has to be created by the participants based on your paper and that would be presented before the experts. The entire report/paper in form of three hard copies and one soft copy should be brought to the venue for judges.

<br>11. Audio /video are strictly prohibited. Pictures and Graph may be used.
 <br>12. Decision of the judges will be final.
