<h2>Introduction </h2>
A perfect platform to manifest your creative skills and logical thinking to materialize a bridge that endures the maximum load to weight ratio.

<dl><h2>Details:</h2>
<dd><h3>Problem statement :-</h3><br>
Design a bridge model having dimensions given below. Materials will be provided on the spot.
<dd><h3>Dimensions:-</h3><br>
-Length (span): 50 cm.<br>
-Width: 10 cm<br>
There should not be any variations in the dimensions of the bridge, Limiting to an error of 1 cm in width and 2 cm in length.
<dd><h3><dl>Test Conditions:- :</h3>
<dd>1.The Bridge will be kept on a platform which will be available on the spot.
<dd>2.A bucket will be tied to the centre of the bridge using a rope and sand will be filled slowly in to the bucket. The weight at which the bridge breaks will be calculated using an electronic balance.
<dd>3.A bucket will be tied to the centre of the bridge using a rope and sand will be filled slowly in to the bucket. The weight at which the bridge breaks will be calculated using an electronic balance.

<dl><h2>Rules :</h2>
<dd>1. Maximum 3 Members per team. Participants from different institutions can form a team.
<dd>2. Adhesives and Popsicle sticks will be provided on the spot.
<dd>3.It is not compulsory to use all the sticks.
<dd>4. Use of material other than given is not permitted.
<dd>5. Participants should bring their own scale, pencil n cutter which they require at the time of the event.
</dl>

<dl><h3>General Rules :</h3>
<dd>1.Shape: Structure could be of absolutely any shape satisfying the above constraints.
<dd>2.Once the structure is weighed, you are not allowed to modify your structure in any way.
<dd>3.If the structure fails to satisfy any of the above constraints then it will be summarily rejected.
<dd>4. Any structure that is not ready with in the time limit will be disqualified immediately.
<dd>5. Participants should bring their own scale, pencil and other items which they require at the time of the event.
<dd>6.Judges' decision shall be final and binding on all.
<dd>7.The organizers reserve all rights to change any or all of the above rules at any point of the event.
<dl>

<h2>WINNING CRITERIA:</h2>
The lightest bridge (that meets the given constraints & dimensions) supporting maximum weight at centre will be declared as the winner.
