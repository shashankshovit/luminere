<h1>Puzzled</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
As fast as an eagle, as slow as a slug. As tall as a tree, as small as a bug. Sometimes in front, sometimes behind. Never on top, and always aligned. 
Just let your bulbs glow, and you will see its your  “shadow”. <br>
Since its not always about scratching your brains till question marks fly off from paper to  head, it might not be about rubik cubes, sudokus, hanoi towers , nonograms or any donkey work. So as we put the brainy minds to rest in peace , the distracted ones can pop out alive.
Finally with lots of fun loving puzzles and a belief that art of simplicity is a puzzle of complexity, we present to you PUZZLED
